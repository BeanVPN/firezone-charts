# Firezone chart
[Firezone](https://www.firezone.dev/) is an open-source remote access platform built on WireGuardÂ®, a modern VPN protocol that's 4-6x faster than OpenVPN. Deploy on your infrastructure and start onboarding users in minutes.

## TL;DR

```console
helm install firezone ./firezone
```

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [Firezone](https://www.firezone.dev/) deployment on a Kubernetes cluster using the Helm package manager.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.21+
- Helm 3.2.0+
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
helm install my-release ./firezone
```

The command deploys PostgreSQL on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [Parameters](#parameters) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```console
helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components but PVC's associated with the chart and deletes the release.

To delete the PVC's associated with `my-release`:

```console
kubectl delete pvc -l release=my-release
```

> **Note**: Deleting the PVC's will delete postgresql data as well. Please be cautious before doing it.
